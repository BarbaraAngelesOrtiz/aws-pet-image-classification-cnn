Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three architectures (VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet) classified Dog_01.jpg as American Staffordshire terrier / pit bull terrier.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The classifications for Dog_02.jpg differed across all models:

* VGG → Italian greyhound

* AlexNet → Sulphur-crested cockatoo (not even a dog)

* ResNet → Whippet
None of the models matched Dog_01 and Dog_02 to the same breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes. All three models correctly classified the non-dog images:

* Cat_01.jpg → Tabby cat

* Coffee_mug_01.jpg → Coffee mug


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG performed the best overall. Both ResNet and VGG misclassified the breed of Dog_02, but at least they still recognized it as a dog. 
AlexNet, on the other hand, misclassified Dog_02 as a bird, which is a much larger error. 
Therefore, VGG is the most reliable among the three for this small test set.
